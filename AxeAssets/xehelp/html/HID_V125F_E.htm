.(BUG)
   -(wxe/gxe) wxp cmd ABEND when Horizontal and vertical HEX display mode.
   -NUM setr/setr cmd did not check margin overflow.
   -Shift line cmd hove to consider COBOL lineno column(col.1-6)
   -Word search cmd(FWF/FWB/IWF/IWB).
      When delimiter is multibyte string( xxx of &quot;(xxx&quot; ),
      if xxx is not found on the cursor line, word to be searched is from top of the line.
      It should be up to next/previous default delimiter such as space.
   -TC cmd
      Constanst string of copy cmd(like as TC 1-10=&quot;AsciiString&quot;) should be translated for UTF8 file.
      &quot;N&quot; (Numeric field check) option of TC FMT cmd was ignored if the file is not UTF8 file.
   -SPLit cmd
      delimiter of STRDELM option was ignored for UTF8 file if it is DBCS string.
   -ABEND if CHARSET option is missing with  CONVERTER=1 (ICU)

.<A href="HID_RECORD_E.htm">RECORD Mode</A> Edit cmd option.
  -EndOfLineID(LF/NL) is not usualy used on mainframe world.
   Line is split by record length associated to each file.
   This option is used to edit the file downloaded from mainframe host.
  -E filename /M[m|p|u|t|R][m|p|u|R] /Fn[-m]
      R:record modeÅi1st &quot;R&quot; is read option, 2nd &quot;R&quot; is write option)
         p:EOL-ID=0x0d0a, u:EOL-ID=0x0a, m:EOL-ID=0x0d
      Fn[-m]:Record length and margin.
        ex). F80-72.  record length:80, Col.73-80 is righ margin
   ex). &quot;e file1 /Mr /F80-72 P0&quot;
  -Record mode read each lines by fixed length specified on Fn[-m] option, write no EOL-ID.
   Record mode option and record length parameter is registered to profile.
   To write EOLID to each lines open the file with /Mr[p|u|m] option.
   To remove EOLID from non-record mode file open the file with /M[p|u|m]r
   and after saved re-open it with /Mr Fxx.
   To reset record mode register on profile, specify /M option.
   /F0 option will also reset is.
  -Change of record size.
    EDIt cmd with new /F option will override lrecl on profile.
    You can change it at REPlace/CREate/SAVE cmd.
      REPlace/CREate/SAVe  filename  [/M[p|u|m|r]]  [/Fn[-m]]
    /M option changes record mode&lt;--&gt;Linefeed by EOLID mode
    /F option changes record size.
    (For SAVe cmd, this is effective only when filename parameter is specified. 
     Without filename parameter, you can change record mode by /M option of EDIt cmd.
     Record size will not be changed).

      ex.1)  cre file1 cpeb /mr /f80
            create EBCDIC 80 byte record mode file from usual PC text file.
      ex.2)  s   file2 cplc /mp
            reverse operation of ex.1)
  -/M write option is effective for REP cmd for the file if no /M, /F option specified.
    For ex, &quot;rep file2 cplc&quot; for the file opened by &quot;e file1 cpeb /mr f80&quot;,
    short record is expnded to the LRECL, record mode and LREC are registered to file2's profile record.
    If file1 is opened by &quot;e file1 cpeb /mrp&quot;, EOLid is appended to all lines.
  -Record mode is assumed for EBCDIC file opened by E8 cmd.
  -Inserting character into the line could not expand the line over the record length.
  -TAB counter is forced to 1 at open.
   TAB is relaced to a spce if &quot;NOTC&quot; option is not specified.
  -Record mode is not proper for UTF8 file because UTF8-code size is valiable.

.<A href="HID_EBCF_E.htm">EBCDIC file support</A>.

  -EBCDIC encoded file is maintained as it is without translation to locale codepage.
   Hex display mode displays EBCDIC code.
   Use this function for the file downloaded from mainframe with no translation option
   or NFS mounted with no translation option.
   Unicode is used to display code, it enable to dispaly wider range of printable character.

  -CPEB option is used for EDIt/SAVe/REPlace/CREate/APPend/CUT/END/COPy/MOVe/PASte cmd.
   IE option may be required if invalid EBCDIC code is contained.
   Indicater on header line is &quot;=E&quot; , and &quot;=e&quot; when binary mode.
     ex). &quot;e file1 cpeb&quot;
   COPy/MOVe/PASte cmd inserts lines after translated from specified codepage to the encoding of th opened file.
   SAVe/REPlace/CREate/APPend/CUT/END cmd write lines after translated to the specified codepage.
     ex). &quot;rep file2 cpeb nx ie&quot;
   Specified option on output cmd is registered to profile. 
   COPy/MOVe/PASte cmd checks profile, so you may not be required to specify CPxx option.
   Option specified to a directory is default for the file in the directory.
   To reset profile specify explicuitly other(CPLC/CPU8/CPAS) encoding option at open.

  -Cmd for write dose not update profile if translation error is detected,
   file is written upto EOF replacing those error character to substitution character.
   Substitution character depends to the codepage, you can change it by cfg parameter.
   Sometimes DBCS subchar is not defined, xe try to translate u-fffd, u-ff1f(DBCS &quot;?&quot;),u-3000(DBCS space)
   in this sequence the use it if available.

  -About DBCS
   Double Byte Character is indicated by SO(ShiftOut:0x0e) and SI(ShiftIn:0x0f) in EBCDIC.
   SO and SI enclose DBCS string. ex). 0e-40-40-0f is DBCS space.
   In other than EBCDIC, specific leading byte and some following bytes is combination of DBCS.
   Display width of DBCS is 2 column and it may be consists by 3 byte (EUC-SS3) or 3 byte(GB18030).
   ex). DBCS space is 81-40 in MS932.
   Accordingly translation between EBCDIC and Locale code changes line length if DBCS is contained. 
   Option of treatement of SO/SI is prepared on translation cmd.
   Set default to cfg file.
   cfg option is applied to &quot;C&quot;opy line cmd which has no parameter for SI/SI option.
     ex).  COPy     file1 cpeb -sd       :Delete SO/SI from EBCDIC copy source file. Line length will shrink.
           COPy     file1 cpeb -sr       :SO/SI is replaced to one space.
           REPlace  file1 cpeb -sr       :SO/SI is inserted at translation to EBCDIC,
                                          but replace both side of space if avail.
           REPlace  file1 cpeb -si       :SO/SI is inserted simply. Line length will expand.
   Define default action on cfg file.
       SOSI_A2E      REP (=&quot;-sr&quot;) or INS (&quot;=-si&quot;)
       SOSI_E2A      DEL (=&quot;-sd&quot;) or REP (&quot;=-sr&quot;) 

  -Codepage and translation option by cfg file.
     Specify cfg filename on INI file. Default is ::xeebc.cfg.
       EBCDIC_cfg        =&quot;&quot; #(&quot;::xeebc.map&quot;)# EBCDIC translation config filename
     Syntax is same as previously used for 3270 connection.
       Following option is added for non-3270 as alternative of option in xehosts file.
       This is for Windows/Japanese user with no external converter option only.
        SJIS_OPT  ENG_EXT      # Japanese English-Extension(CP939=CP1027)
        SJIS_OPT  KANA_EXT     # Japanese Katakana-Extension(CP930=CP290)
     -MF:mapfile option of CV cmd for B2M/M2B was discarded, 
     CV cmd share mapping option specified on INI file.
     Default option when missing cfg file is as following.
       (Windows)
         Japanese :Codepage=CP930(Internal mapping table equivalent to Japanese-Katakana Extension), JIS83.
         else     :Codepage=CP037, No DBCS(SO/SI) consideration.
       (Linux)
         Japanese :Codepage=EUC-JP(Internal mapping table equivalent to Japanese-Katakana Extension), JIS83.
         else     :Codepage=CP037, No DBCS(SO/SI) consideration.
       Above default is used when CONVERTER=0 on cfg file, you can specify additional option 
       such as SOSI,SJIS option.
       SOSI option is effective for CV cmd only, ignored for EDIt operation.
       it is forced to INS for SOSI_A2E, REP for SOSI_E2A.

     (ex) sample to use External(ICU/iconv) converter, Windows codepage.
           On Windows, you may have to add the EBCDIC codepage using 
             Control-Panel--&gt;Region and Languages
           WindowsXP currently have no EBCDIC codepage supporting DBCS.
           So, CJK user may have to install ICU to use DBCS EBCDIC. (COVERTER=0 supports Japanese)
           To use ICU you may have to PATH for DLL/so. Set LIBPATH or LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

           Codepage value on CHARSET statement varies by ICU/Windows/LinuxICONV.
           Confirm it using &quot;uconv -l&quot; (ICU) or &quot;iconv -l&quot;.
           For codepage on Windows, check it by Control-panel--&gt;Region and Language.

           -Use ICU SBCS. 
              CONVERTER          1
              ICU_DLL_SUFFIX    44
              ICU_API_SUFFIX   _44  
              SBCS_CHARSET     cp1047          //EBCDIC Latin/1 Open System(iso-8859-1)

           -Use ICU DBCS. 
              CONVERTER          1
              ICU_DLL_SUFFIX    44
              ICU_API_SUFFIX   _44  
              DBCS_CHARSET     cp1388          //chinese simplified. superset of cp935

           -Use Windows MultiByteToWideChar/WideCharToMultibute API.
              CONVERTER          2
              SBCS_CHARSET       20924        //EBCDIC Latin/1 Open System(1047+Euro)

           -Use Linux iconv API.
              CONVERTER          1
              SBCS_CHARSET       cp1047

     Translation of EndOfLine ID may not be preferable.
         EBCDIC NL(x15)--&gt;u0085, LF(x25)--&gt;u000a 
         ASCII  LF(0x0a)--&gt;EBC-15/EBC-25
     You can remap it as following.
         MAP_E2A  0x15: 0x0a   # EBCDIC 0x15(NL) -&gt; ASCII 0a(LF)
         MAP_E2A  0x25: 0x3b   # EBCDIC 0x25(LF) -&gt; ASCII &quot;?&quot;
         MAP_A2E  0x0a: 0x15   # EBCDIC 0x15(NL) &lt;- ASCII 0a(LF)
         

  -CV cmd B2M/M2B option is for CPLC(Locale code)file only.
   To translate the file opened by CPEB option, use REP cmd.
   Cfg file is shared with EDIt cmd, -MFcfgfile option is discarded.
   xe display the file translated by CV cmd width B2M by the locale code,
   The file opened by CPEB option is displayed by Unicode.
   There may be difference in looks.

  -0x09 is not TAB (0x05:EBC-HT also is  not treated as TAB skip character).
   When Tab Key is pressed, TAB char(0x09,0x05) is not inserted into the line,
   but jump some columns even when INS mode.
  -HEX input mode(Ctrl+F11) send byte by byte(no DBCS consideration)
  -SO(0x0e)/SI(0x0f)(DBCS encloser) is displayed by alternative char &quot;?&quot;.
   SO/SI is inserted when DBCS kbd input.
   For Cut&amp;Paste DBCS re-evaluation is done each time.
   DBCS is even byte string enclosed by SO and SI.
   For ex, when paste EBCDIC line into UTF8/Locale code file,
   Translation will be done but unless SO/SI is not included in the pasteing data
   DBCS translation is not done and SBCS translation is done.
   When Joined 2 line split at DBCS position, DBCS may revive.
   TFLow cmd also join line but insert single space between the line joined,
   so DBCS may not revive.
   Invalid DBCS-EBCDIC is displayed by &quot;:;&quot;, confirm the code by vertical hex line.
  -Binary mode by EB cmd or by the reason that file contains too may control char
   dose not consider DBCS. Use ET cmd for later case.
  -Find/Change cmd.
     Regardless of kbd mode is UTF8 or not, search and replace by EBCDI Code on EBCDIC file.
     No DBCS consideration for the file opened by binary mode.
     -g (Grep), P'.' option is not supported.
  - &quot;#&quot; line cmd(Execute cmd descripted on the line) is not supported.

.Other miscellanious.
  -END/SAVe/REPlace/CREate cmd.
   register CPxxÅifile encoding)option to profile.
  -&quot;p&quot;(Print) directory list line cmd get encoding from profile.
  -supports delimiter string by UTF8 code.
   TC FMT, SPLit, TFLow cmd
  -P[0|1] (margin area protection) option of EDIt cmd is registered to profile.
  -When UCS mapping table(internal table to display unicode by 1 coulmn width)
   is overflowed (depends your LANG env) following error msg is issued and
   those unicode is displayed by 2 column. 
      &quot;UCS map tbl overflow....&quot;
   You can use INI file option (mapping file name on UnicodeTbl/UnicodeTbl_Console option)
   to change some unicode range to DBCS area to bypass this situation.
   For ex,
      &quot;2  e000-f8ff          # 1:SBCS,2:DBCS; move Private User Area to DBCS range from SBCS range&quot;
   This allows all SBCS unicode is displayed by 1 column width.
  -UCS4 ( 4 byte unicode) option is added for F2U, U2F translation by CV cmd. 
  -gxe/wxe accects ligature option also to locale code file.(wxe is for utf8 file only).
  -Compare(<A href="HID00000600.htm">&quot;=&quot;</A>) line cmd supports compare between files with differrent encoding.
