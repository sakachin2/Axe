.(BUG)
   -(report from dsk1@de)
     -(LNX) for Linux BigEndian other than S390
     -(S390) &quot;ld&quot; reports pango library missing.
             xxcluded by #ifdef those function not used in S390.
     -keybord reports unnessesary charcter 0x03 by AltGr.
     -source file is removed even if MOVe cmd failed by CPU8--&gt;CPLC translation err.
     -file can not be save after whole update is undoed by the reason of file is not updated.
      If once save, it should be saved to back to the original. 
   -key combination of AltGr(Right-Alt) and Alt(Left-Alt) dose not work.
    for ex, AltGr+&quot;9&quot; is &quot;]&quot; on &quot;DE&quot; kbd, and Alt+AltGr+&quot;9&quot; is not identified as Alt+&quot;]&quot;.
    So, &quot;word search&quot; function is not triggered.
   -&quot;u&quot; key on HEX line of virtical HEX display mode create new UCS2 code from adjasent 2 byte code.
    I fails when the byte code is 0x09(TAB).
   -(LNX) Scroll_Lock is not avail.
    gxe now check Scroll_Lock status. Arrow key scroll screen by 1 column/row when Scroll_Lock ON.
    To activate Scroll_Lock key, following setup may be required. 
      xmodmap -e &quot;add mod3 = Scroll_Lock&quot;
    mod3 is almost standard, but you have to check it using following cmd whether mod 3 is free.
      xmodmap -pm 
      (usualy mod1 is Left-Alt, mod5 is AltGr)
   -(gxe) DoubleClick(Copy Word to clipboard) on UTF8 file causes crash.
   -(wxe) C&amp;P:Invalid translation when double click at lineno column.
              Mouse paste may fail by &quot;region not yet saved&quot;.

.Unicode Combining Character(Diacritical combining).

  -Now disply characters of wcwidth=0. Those were displayed by alternate charcter(&quot;:;&quot;) as unprintable.
   Validity of the combination is not checked.
   (Maximum combination is 4 on Linux console version)
  -Alt+&quot;:&quot; is used to switch display mode Combined--&gt;Split--&gt;Unprintable(single &quot;:&quot;)ï\é¶ÇêÿÇËë÷Ç¶ÇÈéñÇ™Ç≈Ç´ÇÈÅB
  -Visibility of Linux version depends to Linux distribution.
   Try to switch display mode. Displayed string may shift by cursor position.
   Command format: (reposrts current status if operand missong)

     OPT UNICOMB [ COMB | SPLIT | UNPR ] [ SHADOW | ITSELF | PADDING | U-xxxx ]

       COMB, SPLIT, UNPR : display combined, split and alternate character each.
       2nd operand is for Linux Console version only and specify how to write to screen when split mode.
         SHADOW : write combining character with base character of the left side.
         ITSELF : write combining character itself as single.
         PADDING: write tab display character which is cleared by &quot;TAB OFF&quot; cmd
         U-xxxx : any unicode you prefere.

  -Linux GUI version(gxe) print combined mode except &quot;Wysiwig&quot; checkbox is ON.

.Ligature

  -Ligature checkbox is added to also gxe Setup dialog.
  -Alt+&quot;;&quot; is assiged to toggle ON/OFF.
   Alt+&quot;;&quot; is temporary for GUI version and checkbox status is saved.
   For Console version, A+&quot;;&quot; status is saved to ini file.
   Command format: (reposrts current status if operand missong)
     OPT LIGATURE [ON | OFF]

  -When Ligature is ON, character spacing depends to background(Windows,GTK,pango,ncurses).
   If On,keep monospacing.
   Try not only for European font ligature such as ff/fi,  but also RTL langauge such as Arabic.
   Combination mode by &quot;OPT UNICOMB&quot;(or Alt+&quot;:&quot;) may be required also additionally to Ligature ON.
  -For Editor's characteristic, Character at the byte position of the cursor is displayed at there even when Ligature ON.
   For Backspace operation, also the previous position is displayed at the point.
   When cursor is on the HEX line, corresponding position on character line is kept the byte position.
   So, for RTL(RightToLeft) language such as Hevrew,arabic...  It seems that line is split by the cyrsor.
   Though I could not read nor understand it.
  -Ligature option is ignored in the following case.
   Binary file, horizontal hex disply(EH cmd), HEX line of vertical HEX display mode, command input line.

.Other miscellenious.
  -(wxe)double width caret for DBCS.
  -Tested on Windows7.
